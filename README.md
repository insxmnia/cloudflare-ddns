# cloudflare-ddns

This is a standardized Golang project structure. Below is a brief explanation of the directories:

- **deployments**: Contains deployment configurations and infrastructure-as-code files (e.g., Kubernetes YAML files, Terraform scripts).
- **docs**: Contains project documentation, such as user guides, architecture overviews, and API documentation.
- **api**: Holds API definitions, such as OpenAPI specs, gRPC proto files, or API versioning handlers.
- **web**: Contains web assets such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or frontend code if applicable.
- **app**: Contains application-specific code and business logic.
- **build**: Holds the output binaries and artifacts generated during the build process.
- **cmd**: Holds the entry points for the application (e.g., main programs). Each subdirectory represents a different command.
- **internal**: Holds private application and library code that is not meant to be accessible outside the project.
- **pkg**: Contains reusable code within the project that should remain private and inaccessible to external modules.
- **scripts**: Stores automation scripts, such as build, test, and deployment scripts.
- **pkg**: Contains reusable packages that can be used by the project and external applications. Intended for public use.
- **config**: Stores configuration files or related utilities for loading and parsing configuration.
- **test**: Contains additional test data, mocks, or integration test cases.

## Generated Directory Tree

Below is the directory structure created by the script:

```
cloudflare-ddns/
├── cmd/
│   └── main.go
├── pkg/
├── internal/
│   ├── app/
│   └── pkg/
├── config/
├── api/
├── docs/
├── scripts/
│   └── build.sh
├── build/
├── deployments/
├── test/
├── web/
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── directories.info
└── go.mod
```

The following files were created:
- **cmd/main.go**: A simple  that prints "Hello, World!".
- **.gitignore**: Default ignores for Go projects, including the  directory.
- **directories.info**: A file with explanations of each directory in the project.
- **README.md**: A project readme with directory structure and explanations.
- **scripts/build.sh**: A build script to compile the Go application and output the binary to the  directory.
- **go.mod**: Initialized Go module file.

Generated with a script for convenience. Happy coding!
